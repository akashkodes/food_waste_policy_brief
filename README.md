# food_waste_policy_brief

15th Nov marked an important day in mankind as human population crossed the 8 billion mark. As the 
population growth continues it is time that we use the available resources carefully and reduce the waste. 
Over 800 million people live in hunger for their entire life. On the other hand, 35% of food goes 
uneaten or unused in the US annually which is worth $418 billions. In order to curb the waste
US Department of Agriculture (USDA) joined hands with US Environmental Protection Agency (UEPA).

On 16th September 2015, USDA and UEPA announced the U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction goal, 
the first-ever domestic goal. The goal is to reduce food loss by 50% by the end of 2030. To be specific, 
2010 was selected as a baseline at 218.9 pounds of food loss per person and the aim is to reduce this 
to 109.4 pounds. On the other hand, for food waste the target is set to 164 pounds per person 
compared to 328 pounds per person in year 2016. By achieving this goal, the U.S. can improve food 
security and save money while reducing climate and environmental impacts associated with food waste

This policy brief shows the impact of the 2015 food waste policy brief and if it really helped to reduce the waste significantly.
